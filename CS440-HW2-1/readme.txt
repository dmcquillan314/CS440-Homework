This archive contains the three data set files for HW2 and a JAVA file, DataSet.java which may be used to read in and permute the data set files.  The example feature values, the example classification labels, and the feature names of the data set are made availble via three public final variables.  The main function, uneeded for your perceptron work, illustrates how to use the DataSet object.
